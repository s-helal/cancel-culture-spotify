# Exploration of attributes that make a popular TikTok song
## Darya Petrov, Kevin Xu, Radhika Kulkarni, and Sameerah Helal

* Python packages used: requests, pandas, numpy, counter, time, spotipy, time, SpotifyClientCredentials

* This is the final term project of STA141B: Data and Web Technologies for Data Analysis at UC Davis. 

Navigating this project:
1. the `code` folder contains scraper.py which contains the code for scraping data from Spotify using an API
2. the `data` folder contains 4 .csv files, containing the scraped data 
3. the `notebooks` folder contains jupyter notebooks. `Tiktokify_Report.ipynb` is the report writeup. `More_Vis.ipynb` contains more visualizations we created but chose not to include in the writeup.  `Presentation_Slides.ipynb` is the powerpoint we used for our in-class presentation. 

* Motivation:
  - TikTok has been around for a couple years, and in that time has managed to capture a worldwide audience with its enticing songs and consumable content.
  - With music being an important component of TikTok's short-form content, we want to investigate what makes music on TikTok popular to current audiences.
  - We can compare features of popular TikTok songs to popular songs in the United States to estimate relationships.
